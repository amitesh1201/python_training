# The function is the collection of statements.
# Instead of repeating the same code/statements in the program,
# we can create the set of code/statements assign the name to the set call function. \
# The function reduces the repeated code structure and quickly calls whenever required. 
# There are types of functions.
#    1. Nonaurgument function: In such functions do not require argument.
#    2. Single or multi-argument function: The functions require single or multiple arguments according to function structure.
# In any programing language, the user can define the function and use the programmer to define the function.
